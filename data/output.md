# 2.0 TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE TOR

# 2.1 Background to the Project

The Water Resources Authority has issued an expression of interest for the consultancy for the development of a Groundwater Information System (GWIS). This is an initiative of the Government of the Republic of Kenya to implement the Horn of Africa- Groundwater for Resilience Project (HoAGW4RP) with financial support from the International Development Association (IDA) of World Bank Group. With the financial support of the WB and in collaboration with the MOWSI, the WRA PIU will implement its first Groundwater Information System (GWIS) with the objective to increase the sustainable use and management of groundwater by beneficiary groups in the Horn of Africa. The GWIS aims to enhance knowledge and capacity for sustainable use and management of Groundwater in Kenya and trans-boundary aquifers of regional significance in the Horn of Africa.

# 2.2 Objective of the Consultancy

The consultant understands that the purpose of the current ToR is to support the WRA of Kenya to develop a GWIS platform to strengthen the knowledge and capacity to ensure that key hydrogeological data in the selected aquifers can easily be accessed by the key stakeholders and seamlessly integrate with other datasets in order to facilitate sustainable groundwater management in the HoA in the long run.
